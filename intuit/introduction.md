## Technical Interview Introduction

I'm Ravi Kiran, a Senior Software Engineer at Sur La Table specializing in production AI systems (RAG, LLMs) and backend platforms. I work with junior developers, product managers, and cross-functional teams to design and deliver products end-to-end. I hold an M.S. from UT Dallas and a B.Tech from IIT.

- Built MessageWise, a RAG platform on AWS Bedrock, OpenSearch, and Lambda, reducing operational incident resolution time by 66%.
- Implemented an AI email validator using OpenAI and prompt engineering, recovering 67% of invalid addresses.

I enjoy making AI practical, reliable, and trustworthy in real-world operations.

In my leisure time, I enjoy hiking and plan to hike Half Dome next year. I'm also learning to play guitar.
