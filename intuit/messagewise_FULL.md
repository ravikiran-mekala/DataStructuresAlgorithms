# MessageWise: RAG-Powered Operational Support Platform

## 1) One-Line Hook
I built a RAG/LLM platform that reduces support ticket resolution from 50 to 20 minutes and cuts developer escalations by 32 percentage points, starting with email deliverability issues that represented 60% of our operational alerts at Sur La Table.

---

## 2) Context & Role
**Org & domain:** Sur La Table, premium cookware retailer with extensive cooking class programs and sophisticated digital operations. Our Production Support team handles diverse operational challenges across e-commerce, inventory, payment processing, and critically, email communications that drive 45M messages monthly.

**Your role:** Senior Software Developer responsible for building data pipelines, API integrations, and system observability. I identified an opportunity to apply RAG/LLM technology to transform how our support team handles operational incidents.

**Why this mattered now:** Production Support team of 10 engineers was drowning in alerts—50 daily across all systems, with 70% requiring developer escalation. This pattern was unsustainable, pulling developers away from feature development for routine troubleshooting. We needed an AI solution that could democratize operational knowledge.

---

## 3) Problem Discovery (How you identified it)
**Signal:** Analysis of our incident management system revealed that 70% of all production support tickets required developer escalation, despite many having documented resolutions scattered across various knowledge bases.

**Pain points:** 
- Support engineers spending 50+ minutes per incident searching through disparate information sources
- Knowledge trapped in CloudWatch logs, runbooks, wikis, Slack history, and developer minds
- Repetitive questions consuming 30% of developer time
- Critical operational knowledge not accessible during incidents
- No systematic way to leverage past incident resolutions

**Evidence:**
- ~50 alerts daily across all systems
- ~20 requiring formal Jira tickets (>3 min resolution threshold)
- 70% developer escalation rate overall
- Email alerts specifically: 60% of total ticket volume
- Average resolution time: 50 minutes for non-escalated tickets

**Current workaround & its limits:** Manual searches through Amazon Managed Grafana, CloudWatch dashboards, internal wikis, and tribal knowledge. Limits: requires deep expertise, slow pattern recognition, inconsistent knowledge access.

---

## 4) Hypothesis & Success Criteria
**Hypothesis:** A RAG-powered LLM platform can serve as an intelligent layer over our operational data, providing contextual answers with citations to reduce resolution time and developer escalations across all incident types.

**Metrics to move:**
- Time-to-resolve: Target -30% reduction (platform-wide)
- Developer escalation rate: Target <50% (from 70%)
- User helpfulness rating: Target ≥80%
- Knowledge accessibility: 100% searchable incident history

**Guardrails:**
- PII protection and data security
- Citation requirements for trust
- Deterministic responses for operational consistency
- Role-based access control
- Audit trail for compliance

**Go/No-Go thresholds:**
- p95 latency ≤ 5 seconds
- ≥80% helpful ratings
- -20% reduction in resolution time
- 99% responses include verifiable citations

## 5) POC (What actually happens in a POC)
**Strategic choice:** We selected email deliverability as our POC domain because:
- Represented 60% of support tickets
- Had clear patterns and documented ISP guidelines
- Measurable business impact ($120K/month revenue risk)
- Well-defined success metrics

**Scope:** Email bounce issues, specifically Yahoo campaigns and DKIM/DMARC alignment

**Data sample:** 
- 8 weeks of operational data (~70M email events)
- 200 incident resolutions
- 50 runbooks and technical documentation
- ISP guidelines and best practices

**Baseline:** 
- Email incident resolution: 50 minutes average
- Email escalation rate: 70%

**Tech spikes:**
- RAG architecture with OpenSearch hybrid retrieval
- LLM integration via Amazon Bedrock

- Accuracy and groundedness testing
- Citation verification
- Response consistency validation

**POC outcome:** Proved the platform concept with email use case: 30% faster resolution, 80% satisfaction, clear path to expand to other domains

## 18) Q&A Prep (Crisp Answers)

**Why start with email?**
Email represented 60% of our support tickets with clear patterns, measurable impact ($120K/month), and available documentation. Perfect proof-of-concept for the broader platform.

**How does this scale to other domains?**
Plugin architecture allows new data sources without rebuilding. Core RAG pipeline, retrieval, and LLM orchestration remain constant. Each domain adds specific tools and knowledge.

**Why RAG instead of training custom models?**
Operational data changes daily. RAG provides real-time access with citations. Fine-tuning would require constant retraining and couldn't provide source verification.

**What's the competitive advantage?**
Unified platform across all operations, not siloed tools. Citations build trust. Extensible architecture enables rapid expansion. Democratizes expertise across the organization.

**How do you measure success beyond email?**
Platform metrics: overall escalation reduction, knowledge accessibility, query volume growth, cross-domain insights. Each domain has specific KPIs like email's resolution time.

**What's the long-term vision?**
Transform from reactive support to proactive operations. AI predicts issues before they occur. Automated remediation for known problems. Complete operational intelligence platform.
