# Professional Introduction - Ravi Kiran

## Full Introduction (2-3 minutes)

Hello, I'm Ravi Kiran. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Sur La Table with a strong background in AI and machine learning applications for operational excellence.

I completed my Master's degree at the University of Texas at Dallas and earned my undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology. This educational foundation in both theoretical computer science and practical engineering has shaped my approach to building scalable, intelligent systems.

At Sur La Table, I work at the intersection of traditional software engineering and cutting-edge AI. My role involves collaborating closely with customers, product managers, and cross-functional teams to design and develop new features and products from the ground up. 

My most impactful contributions include:
- **MessageWise Platform**: Led the development of a RAG/LLM-powered support system that reduced incident resolution time by 66% (from 50 to 20 minutes) and decreased developer escalations by 32 percentage points. This platform handles 350+ queries weekly and saves approximately $120,000 monthly in protected revenue.
- **AI-Enhanced Email Validation**: Introduced machine learning into our email validation workflow, improving deliverability for 45 million monthly emails and recovering 67% of previously invalid addresses through intelligent correction.

Prior to Sur La Table, I interned at BlackBerry as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I developed malware detection systems achieving 97% accuracy in identifying malicious programs.

Outside of work, I'm an avid hiker with dreams of conquering Angel's Landing and Half Dome next year. I'm also currently learning to play guitar, which provides a creative balance to my technical work.

I'm passionate about using AI to augment human capabilities and solve real operational challenges. I believe my experience building production AI systems and my enthusiasm for continuous learning would make me a valuable addition to your team.

## Casual/Culture Fit Introduction

Hey, I'm Ravi Kiran. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Sur La Table where I get to work on some really interesting AI problems. I love the challenge of taking complex technology like RAG and LLMs and making them actually useful for people's daily work.

My biggest win recently was building a system that helps our support team solve problems 66% faster—it's incredibly satisfying seeing AI make people's jobs easier rather than harder.

I studied at UT Dallas for my Master's and did my undergrad at IIT. Before Sur La Table, I interned at BlackBerry working on malware detection.

Outside work, you'll probably find me on a hiking trail—I'm planning to tackle Angel's Landing and Half Dome next year. I'm also teaching myself guitar, which is humbling in a good way!

I really enjoy collaborative environments where I can work with product managers and customers to build things that matter.
