"""
Given an array arr[] consisting of positive, negative, and zero values, 
find the maximum product that can be obtained from any contiguous subarray of arr[].

fun(arr) -> int.

mx_product = - math.inf

Input: arr[] = [-2, 6, -3, -10, 0, 2]
Output: 180
Explanation: The subarray with maximum product is [6, -3, -10] with product = 6 * (-3) * (-10) = 180.

Input: arr[] = [-1, -3, -10, 0, 6]
Output: 30
Explanation: The subarray with maximum product is [-3, -10] with product = (-3) * (-10) = 30.

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4] 
Output: 24 
Explanation: For an array with all positive elements, the result is product of all elements.
